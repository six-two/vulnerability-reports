# Encrypted reports

If you have received a link to a file in this folder, you can download the file and decrypt it using [gpg](https://gnupg.org/):

```
gpg -d ~/Downloads/202X-XXX.md.gpg > ~/Downloads/202X-XXX.md
```

If you are asked for a password, you should have received one in my message to you.
Otherwise it is encrypted with your public key.
